The main contribution of MTools is to allow object oriented programming in Mathematica in a very natural way .

The package also contains:
 - Generic classes for manipulating trees of objects and displaying them
 - Automatic interface generation for displaying and editing objects
 - Functions for doing asynchronous evaluation easily using parallel kernels (MSync)
 - Tools for accessing Couchbase, serializing and deserializing objects.

## Usage example

You can find usage examples on the [Wolfram Community](http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/880686) site and
in the [answer to "Once more on object orientation..." question](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/119896/66)
on Mathematica Stack Exchange.

More examples will be added in the MTools.nb notebook located in the MTools package.


## Installation

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest released
   [MTools.zip](https://github.com/faysou/MTools/releases/download/1.0.1/MTools.zip)
   file.

2. Extract the downloaded `MTools.zip` file to any directory which is on the
   Mathematica `$Path`, e.g. to one obtained by evaluating
   `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,"Applications"}]`.

3. To load the package evaluate: ``Needs["MTools`"]``

## Compatibility

This package requires Mathematica 10 and above, as it makes extensive use of Association.
